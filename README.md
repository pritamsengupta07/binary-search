# Binary Search Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Python for searching elements in a sorted list. Additionally, an interactive web interface has been created using HTML and CSS to showcase the algorithm visually.

## Features

- **Binary Search Algorithm:** The core functionality of the project is the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Python. It efficiently searches for an element in a sorted list, demonstrating the divide-and-conquer approach.

- **Interactive Web Interface:** The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with HTML and CSS. This interface allows users to input a sorted list and a target element. The Binary Search algorithm is then applied, and the steps are visually displayed.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-search-project.git
   cd binary-search-project
   ```

2. **Run the Python Script:**
   ```bash
   python binary_search.py
   ```
   Follow the instructions in the terminal to provide the sorted list and the target element.

3. **Open the HTML Interface:**
   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the interactive web interface. Input the sorted list and the target element, then click the "Search" button to visualize the Binary Search algorithm steps.

## Project Structure

- **`binary_search.py`:** Python script containing the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm.

- **`index.html`:** HTML file for the interactive web interface.

- **`style.css`:** CSS file for styling the HTML interface.

- **`assets/`:** Directory containing any additional assets, such as images or icons used in the web interface.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Web browser with HTML5 and CSS3 support
